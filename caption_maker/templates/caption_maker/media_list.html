<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  So basically, I wanted to practice my Chinese by listening to music and then follow along on a 
  script in order to memorize phrases, sentence structures, characters, etc.  Unfortunately, I hadn't 
  found a good way to do this aside from blankly staring at a word document or a piece of paper while 
  playing the song off of YouTube.  After failing to find chinese songs on YouTube with closed-captioning, 
  I wondered if I could do it myself.  So I made this and now I can, and so can you!  I still have some 
  work to do in order to make the user interface more friendly, but so far this is looking pretty good 
  if I do say so myself.
